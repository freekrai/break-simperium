break-simperium
==============

Simperium is a simple way for developers to move data as it changes, instantly and automatically. 

I want to really test Simeperium, so this app is going to be a two-sided live blog app.

One side, the frontend, will see how Simperium handles being hammered by lots of visitors who want to keep updated on an event

The other side, the backend, will see how Simperium handles having multiple users posting updates at the same time, see where the treshold is.
